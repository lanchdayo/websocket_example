# Installation

## VS Code Remote Containers

1. [Set up your machine](https://aka.ms/vscode-remote/containers/getting-started) and then start VS Code and open your project folder.
2. Press <kbd>F1</kbd>, select the **Remote-Containers: Add Development Container Configuration Files...** command, and pick one of definitions from the list. (You may need to choose the **From a predefined container configuration definition...** option if your project has an existing Dockerfile or Docker Compose file.)
3. See the definition's `README` for configuration options. A link is available in the `.devcontainer/devcontainer.json` file added to your folder.
4. Run **Remote-Containers: Reopen in Container** to use it locally, or commit the file to source control to [use it with Codespaces](https://docs.github.com/en/github/developing-online-with-codespaces/configuring-codespaces-for-your-project#using-a-pre-built-container-configuration).
